# TSED
Tsed (tiny stanix editor) is a tiny cli editor made with no ncurses dependencies, supporting basic file opening, saving and editing.
The editor mainly target stanix, but the minimum dependencies requirements makes it really easy to port into others minimal os, as long you edit the program.

The editor has it's own ASCII cursor using '|', which isn't optimal but perfect for operating systems without cursors. It supports multi lines, multi collumns, backspacing, and a part of tabulations (replacing tabs by spaces), 
which makes it a very tiny editor but functional.

This branch wont receive any new features excluding full tab support in the future, but apart from that, mainly fixes.
Another branch named stanix will get new features, it will be less portable however.
